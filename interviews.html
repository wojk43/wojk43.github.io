      <h2>Interviews</h2>
      <h3>Interview Format</h3>
      <p>
        While each college has its own nuances, there are typically shared characteristics. 
        <ul>
          <li> Interviewers dive straight into mathematical questions. Expect little discussion about general questions such as "what makes you a better applicant than others</li>
          <li> Most applicants will have two interviews. Either scheduled across one day or multiple within a short time period, depending on the college. Some colleges, however, may only have one.</li>
          <li> Gonville & Caius offers flexibility by allowing interviewees to choose one of the interview topics.</li>
          <li> Selwyn often asks questions related to your personal statement, be prepared!</li>
          <li> Interviews often feature multi-part questions, where the answer from one part naturally leads to the other. Try to recognise this when ready and draw insights.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      
      <h3> Pre-interview assessments </h3>
      <p> 
        <ul>
          <li> For Oxford, applicants are required to sit the Mathematics Admissions Test (MAT) before the interview. This determines whether or not an interview is offered.</li>
          <li> For Cambridge, colleges such as Trinity require an additional pre-interview assessment. </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      
      <h3> General advice </h3>
      <h4> Before interview </h4>
      <ul>
        <li> Skip generic interview prep. Questions such as "Why do you want to study mathematics" are rarely asked, so focus on mathematics instead.</li>
        <li> Work through interview-style maths problems and narrate your thought process. This will help you become more comfortable explaining your reasoning in real time. Some resources for this are attached at  the bottom. </li>
        <li> Since covid-19, interviews are often held online. Consider getting a graphics tablet early and practice writing maths on it clearly.</li>
        <li> Unless you are applying to colleges such as Gonville & Caius, it's unlikely you will face any material beyond AS-level mathematics. Time spent on more advanced content is usually wasted.</li>
        <li> Arrange mock interviews with friends, teachers or tutors. They help reduce nerves and make the format feel more familiar. </li>
      </ul>
      <h4> During interview </h4> 
      <ul>
        <li> Interviewers are assessing your potential. If you get stuck, it is better to use a hint and keep on progressing than not moving at all.</li>
        <li> Explain what you are doing, even if you're unsure. Interviews want to see how you think and the reasoning process is just as important as the final result. </li>
        <li> It's normal to pause and think before speaking. Interviewers understand that nerves are part of the process.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4> After interview! </h4>
      <ul>
        <li> The hard part is over! Give yourself permission to relax.</li>
        <li> Once it is done, dwelling on your performance won't help. Distract yourself with other activities</li>
        <li> <b> You may wish to start preparing for STEP early if applying to Cambridge. </b> </li>
      </ul>
      <p> 
        Whether or not you get into Oxbridge, your worth and future is not defined by a single university. Many applicants go on to thrive at other top universities, both academically and personally. For example, I personally fell short on STEP and ended up at Durham, which I am now happy with. Disappointment is natural, but sometimes it is worth reflecting on <b>why</b> you're applying and what you want from your degree.
