    <h2> Format </h2>
    <p> The first thing that I'd like to talk about is the format of the interviews. </p>
    <p> While each college may have a slightly different interview style, in the end they all focus on just asking math questions.
      There are some idiosyncrasies for every college. For example, Selwyn, Cambridge may ask questions from your personal statement.
      Gonville and Caius, Cambridge give you an option on the topics of one of your interviews. 
      Some colleges have one interview, some have two interviews. </p>
    <p> Typically, universities don't care too much about your personal statement and care much more about your predicted grades etc. 
      Even though this is true, it is still important to check for your college's interview style on their website to see how exactly it works </p>
    <p> The most standard format is having two interviews either on the same day or separate days depending on where you applied. 
      At most, you may be asked how your trip was however they <b> will not </b> as questions such as "<i> What makes you a better applicant than others</i>".
    <p> The interview is aimed to be purely mathematical and the interviewers are almost certainly going to go straight into asking questions.</p>
    <p> The questions can be both multi-part or single part. If a question is a multi-part question, it is usually the case that they want you to see 
      or acknowledge something that you're going to have to use in a later part of the question.</p>

    <h2> Pre-interview exams </h2>
    <p> At Oxford, you are required to take the MAT before your interviews. More on this can be found on the <a href="mat.html"> MAT page </a>.<p>
    <p> At Cambridge, some colleges such as Trinity, require you to take a pre-interview assessment</p>
