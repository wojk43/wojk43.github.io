      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>My name is Wojciech Kowalczyk, and I am a student entering my final year of my mathematics masters degree at Durham University.</p>
      <p>Over the past few years, I have been deeply involved in advanced mathematics, exploring areas such as algebraic number theory, elliptic curves and modular forms (Silverman, Diamond & Shurman etc.).
      While I originally intended to pursue an academic career, I have recently decided to pivot into software engineering, where I can apply my problem solving skills to another field.</p>
      <p> In addition to my study, I have been involved in many mathematical competitions on both national and international levels.</p>
      
      <h2>Software engineering</h2>
      <p> I am now actively developing my expertise in software engineering, with interests including Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Django and more. </p>

      <h2>Resources</h2>
      <p>For those preparing for Oxbridge Mathematics applications:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Interview Advice: Guidance on what to expect, how to prepare, common pitfalls and most importantly various resources.</li>
        <li>STEP Resources: A breakdown of the STEP exam format, preparation strategies and many recommended materials.</li>
      </ul>
      <p> These resources are all available on the right hand side.</p>
      <h2>Tutoring</h2>
      <p> Alongside my studies, I also offer private tutoring for students preparing for mathematics exams and university applications.</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Tutoring covers: GCSE mathematics, A-Level Mathematics, A-Level Further Mathematics, Oxbridge interview practice.</li>
        <li> Approach: Confidence building, clear explanations on how to approach questions, mock interviews (if applies) and more. First session free!</li>
        <li> Format: Online through zoom - flexibility for UK students and abroad.</li>
        <li> Experience: Years of competition training, tutoring and supporting students. Own a community for STEP prep with thousands of members.</li>
        <li> If interested, send an email to woj (dot) tutor (at) gmail (dot) com, where (dot) is replaced by . and (at) is replaced by @ (spam purposes).</li>
