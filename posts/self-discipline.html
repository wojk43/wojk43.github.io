      <h2>My journey with self-discipline</h2>
      <h5>Dec 1, 2022</h5>
      <p>This page was created to talk about my journey with self-discipline and how you can also stop procrastinating</p>
      <h3>Why I started</h3>
      <p>I always found it hard to balance my life. Whether it be studying too much, studying too little. 
      Whether it be depriving myself from sleep in favour of work or depriving myself from sleep and then
      end up procrastinating anyway. I've always had trouble picking out exactly how much time I should be 
      spending on everything.
      </p>
      <p>This 'journey' kind of began when I was using <i>Discord</i> a lot more than I'd like to admit. I'd always have open
      on the side and even though I guess I kind of studied, I felt bad for not doing enough and yet I still couldn't get myself
      to do more. There were some days where I had huge outbursts of motivation and studied for maybe 10 hours straight, but then
      at times I would get distracted by one thing and not work again for a couple of days. This was a huge problem. Not getting 
      a lot of work done and feeling bad about myself while only wasting my time. And the fact is that this wasted time wasn't me
      taking a break, it was wasting time for the sake of wasting time. That's when I decided enough was enough and I wanted to
      change my life for the better.
      </p>
      <h3>How I went about building self-discipline</h3>
      <h4>Eradicating my main distraction</h4>
      <p>
      Firstly, I located the main root of the problem. For me, it was <i>Discord</i>. I did the obvious thing and decided to stop
      using it. But it wasn't a process as simple as that. Of course, when building self-discipline, you need to be realistic and
      make sure everything you do is sustainable. I decided to quit Discord for precisely 6 days per week with the exception of 
      asking for help with questions. I have a 'break' one day per week for which I can go on Discord and that's it. This is to
      make sure that my goal is still realistic and sustainable, I have many people I can only contact through Discord and just
      writing it off completely would be a huge leap. Now, you have to understand that this intrinsic motivation isn't enough to
      push me. It might be for some, but I needed some incentive to make sure that I do not go on. That's where I decided ot put
      in stakes, I decided to pay my friend £10 for every day I go onto Discord for anything non-academic, even the slightest 
      text message sent to someone. For some this £10 may not seem like a lot, but you must understand that I'm a broke student
      so £10 is a small fortune for someone like me.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Building discipline with a smaller task and putting off instant gratification</h4>
      <p>
      Removing my main distraction was the obvious step. But this wasn't enough to actually stop me from procrastinating.
      Me being me, I procrastinated by reading books on procrastination. Now, I don't regret using that as a means of 
      procrastination because I've learned a lot and effectively made myself into a much happier and better person overall.
      One of these books recommended that to build self-discpline with something you want to do, you have to start building
      self-discipline with something that does not provide instant gratification. One of those things is working out. Working
      out is great, you can do it for free, it builds your confidence and makes you a happier person. There is no downside with
      working out. Now this is a great thing to do when building self-discipline for the reason that you dont morph into Arnold
      over a day of working out. You need to work hard multiple times per week to see noticeable progress after some time. This
      slow progress is perfect for building self-discipline as you don't gain any instantaneous rewards for it and yet it only
      helps you. The key thing is to keep going with working out and sticking to your workout schedule no matter how hard it
      gets. If you can work out after a hard day at work or many lectures when you get home, thats great. If you don't feel 
      like working out, just get to it and before you know it, it'll be over. This is similar to building self-discipline with
      other things. When you can do things you don't feel like doing but do them anyway, you know its a great first step.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Becoming comfortable with the uncomfortable</h4>
      <p>
      When I started my journey, I decided to start taking cold showers each and every day, for 5 minutes. I absolutely hated
      these and I couldn't wait to get out each time, yet I still stuck to it. This definitely helped me become more comfortable
      with situations I'm not used to. In fact, at the very start, the cold water hitting my skin made me a bit dizzy, but after
      a week or so, it was just habitual to hop under the shower and start washing myself. Before I noticed, the 5 minutes was 
      already over. Now, it may just sound like I was trying to build self-discipline by making myself suffer, but this is not
      true! People often mistake self-discipline for suffering, but that is not the case at all. The key thing is to be able to
      feel good in situations that don't usually feel good to you. This way you can face challenges more easily and readily. 
      Once I felt like this was no longer necessary because I was super comfortable with cold showers, I stopped returned to
      hot showers.
      In addition to this, as a high achieving STEM student, there's always that little bit of pride that comes with you. You
      might be used to do everything completely alone or being ahead of everyone in your class. This is completely normal, but 
      it can also build some pent up emotions on the side that only hold you back. Part of becoming comfortable with the 
      uncomfortable is letting go of that pride you hold and being able to accept failure and rejection. For example, say you're
      struggling with a math problem for hours but you hold too much pride to be able to ask for help with it because you've
      always been solving everything on your own and people expect you to know a lot. You'll feel like a complete imposter if
      people find out that you're not able to solve something. By doing that, the only person you're hurting is yourself. The
      true thing is that even though some people may make a comment, in the end they don't care as much as you think they do.
      If you can expose yourself to mistakes, failure, rejection etc, you can only improve. You can learn from all of this and
      if you're purposely avoiding every way to potentially embarrass yourself or look worse than another then you're only 
      setting yourself back. It's completely ok to be imperfect.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Self-discipline with work</h4>
      <p>
      Alright. I've talked about almost everything except actually working. There are a few things I've noticed time ago, but
      most things aren't as bad once you get started. You may dread doing your homework because you really don't want to do it.
      I mean, obviously it can wait until tomorrow right? One day won't delay you, so where is the problem? One day less of work
      won't delay you either, or starting an hour later. These thoughts pile up and you end up doing very little to no work over
      multiple days or even weeks at a time. The key thing is that you should just start. You don't need to start at an even
      hour. 17:49 is just as good of a time to start working as 18:00. Once you start, you've gone through the initial push and
      from there it only gets easier. You realise that the task isn't as bad as you initially imagined and you are able to keep
      going. Now one thing I started doing was getting small tasks out of the way as soon as they show up. When I eat something,
      I do the dishes after myself straight away. I know I need to do them sooner or later, so why not just do them straight away.
      The same thing applies to a lot of work you may have to do. You know you have to file your taxes anyway, you know you have
      to write that short report anyway, so why not just do it straight away? If you leave it with all the other small things, those
      small things will only turn into bigger things and will eventually become overwhelming. On that note, on the completely other
      side of things, when you have a lot of tasks to do, given you have no small tasks because you've already gotten them out of
      the way, start with the hardest tasks! Often, you'll look at a list of things you need to do... maybe you've made a to-do 
      list of some sort or created a schedule. Whatever it is, you see your hardest task and start dreading it. You'll do all your
      easier tasks first and then be content with that, leaving out your hardest task. The next day arrives... and you're in the 
      same situation again! However, if you're able to do your most difficult task sooner, then all the others will only get 
      easier in the process. You'll realise that nothing else is as bad.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Getting to work</h4>
      <p>
      But Wojciech... The problem is that I just <b>cannot</b> get to work in the first place! That is what you may be thinking
      right now. There are a few things you should note. You may have a big goal in the end. Maybe you want to get a first. Maybe
      you want to study ahead of your course and finish it by summer break. I mean, if someone told you that you have this big 
      task that you need to do with no guidance it would surely be overwhelming. If someone gave me a 500 page book on Differential
      Geometry for example and wanted me to finish reading it by the end of next year, the task would just seem daunting and hard.
      There is so much time, so I wouldn't feel like studying from it. Better yet, I don't even have the appropriate prerequisites
      as of right now! It's a hard task, it's a long task and I dont even know how to get started. I need to study this prerequisite
      that will also take a large amount of time and then I need to get started on this and that. The most important thing is to
      focus on the next step. Not the next one thousand steps. Slightly rephrasing what Shuzo Matsuoka has said in the past: <br><i>
      Think about the past and it'll turn into anger and regret.
      Think about the future and it'll turn into worry.
      In that case, do your best now in this moment. If you stake your life now, you will be alive </i><br>
      It may seem like quite a random thing to say but what I'm saying is that you should focus on now and it'll slowly build up.
      Study that particular chapter of that book today. Review it the next. Maybe take another day to review it the next. Move onto
      the next chapter etc. Before you know it, maybe a month in, you're already over half way into this book. Yet at the start, it
      didn't seem achievable, it seemed like too much, yet you did it. And on that final note... Lower your standards, but not your
      goals. If you want to aim high, that is ok. If you punish yourself and feel bad for not studying 14 hours per day, you will
      only be unhappy.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Avoiding burnout</h4>
      <p>
      I used to be very bad at this. I would stake everything just to do more, to be better. I knew it affected my mental health,
      I knew it affected my physical health, I knew people were worried for me and yet I still did it anyway. From accidentally 
      malnourishing myself in favour of grind, to sleeping and waking up on the same day after a couple of hours of sleep just to
      keep on working. I was doing too much, I wanted to do more than everyone. I felt weak, tired and yet I moved past that and 
      kept on working. My mental health was terrible, my body barely listened to me and I was constantly in pain. There were times
      where I pushed out 15-20 hours of continuous study in one day and it completely destroyed me. But you need to be easy on 
      yourself too. Like previously mentioned, you need to lower your standards. We are not machines, we cannot do everything by
      yourselves. If you need help from someone, ask for help. If you need to take a break, then you need to take a break. I read
      a quote in a book which really caught my attention and it was left up to interpretation. It said '<i>If you don't make time
      for health, then you will have to make time for illness</i>'. The way I see this quote is using "illness" and "health" as 
      umbrella terms. This illness and health is not only physical, but also physical. If you push yourself too hard anywhere and
      don't take care of yourself, then you will be forced to stop because of physical health, or maybe mental health. This could
      be depression, this could be immense stomach pains from malnourishment, this could be feeling unusually tired. Everything 
      can happen. So take that time off when you need to in order to take care of yourself because you want to, not because
      your body or brain is screaming for help. Every other month, make sure to take a longer break too. Whether it be a week off
      studying completely or a cheat week from dieting. A week will not hinder your progress. And even better, if you feel
      restless during this week of your break, then you know that you have finally achieved the self discipline that you wanted. :)
