      <h2>My journey with self-discipline</h2>
      <h5>[date]</h5>
      <p>This page was created to talk about my journey with self-discipline and how you can also stop procrastinating</p>
      <h3>Why I started</h3>
      <p>I always found it hard to balance my life. Whether it be studying too much, studying too little. 
      Whether it be depriving myself from sleep in favour of work or depriving myself from sleep and then
      end up procrastinating anyway. I've always had trouble picking out exactly how much time I should be 
      spending on everything.
      </p>
      <p>This 'journey' kind of began when I was using <i>Discord</i> a lot more than I'd like to admit. I'd always have open
      on the side and even though I guess I kind of studied, I felt bad for not doing enough and yet I still couldn't get myself
      to do more. There were some days where I had huge outbursts of motivation and studied for maybe 10 hours straight, but then
      at times I would get distracted by one thing and not work again for a couple of days. This was a huge problem. Not getting 
      a lot of work done and feeling bad about myself while only wasting my time. And the fact is that this wasted time wasn't me
      taking a break, it was wasting time for the sake of wasting time. That's when I decided enough was enough and I wanted to
      change my life for the better.
      </p>
      <h3>How I went about building self-discipline</h3>
      <h4>Eradicating my main distraction</h4>
      <p>
      Firstly, I located the main root of the problem. For me, it was <i>Discord</i>. I did the obvious thing and decided to stop
      using it. But it wasn't a process as simple as that. Of course, when building self-discipline, you need to be realistic and
      make sure everything you do is sustainable. I decided to quit Discord for precisely 6 days per week with the exception of 
      asking for help with questions. I have a 'break' one day per week for which I can go on Discord and that's it. This is to
      make sure that my goal is still realistic and sustainable, I have many people I can only contact through Discord and just
      writing it off completely would be a huge leap. Now, you have to understand that this intrinsic motivation isn't enough to
      push me. It might be for some, but I needed some incentive to make sure that I do not go on. That's where I decided ot put
      in stakes, I decided to pay my friend £10 for every day I go onto Discord for anything non-academic, even the slightest 
      text message sent to someone. For some this £10 may not seem like a lot, but you must understand that I'm a broke student
      so £10 is a small fortune for someone like me.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Building discipline with a smaller task and putting off instant gratification</h4>
      <p>
      Removing my main distraction was the obvious step. But this wasn't enough to actually stop me from procrastinating.
      Me being me, I procrastinated by reading books on procrastination. Now, I don't regret using that as a means of 
      procrastination because I've learned a lot and effectively made myself into a much happier and better person overall.
      One of these books recommended that to build self-discpline with something you want to do, you have to start building
      self-discipline with something that does not provide instant gratification. One of those things is working out. Working
      out is great, you can do it for free, it builds your confidence and makes you a happier person. There is no downside with
      working out. Now this is a great thing to do when building self-discipline for the reason that you dont morph into Arnold
      over a day of working out. You need to work hard multiple times per week to see noticeable progress after some time. This
      slow progress is perfect for building self-discipline as you don't gain any instantaneous rewards for it and yet it only
      helps you. The key thing is to keep going with working out and sticking to your workout schedule no matter how hard it
      gets. If you can work out after a hard day at work or many lectures when you get home, thats great. If you don't feel 
      like working out, just get to it and before you know it, it'll be over. This is similar to building self-discipline with
      other things. When you can do things you don't feel like doing but do them anyway, you know its a great first step.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Becoming comfortable with the uncomfortable</h4>
      <p>
      When I started my journey, I decided to start taking cold showers each and every day, for 5 minutes. I absolutely hated
      these and I couldn't wait to get out each time, yet I still stuck to it. This definitely helped me become more comfortable
      with situations I'm not used to. In fact, at the very start, the cold water hitting my skin made me a bit dizzy, but after
      a week or so, it was just habitual to hop under the shower and start washing myself. Before I noticed, the 5 minutes was 
      already over. Now, it may just sound like I was trying to build self-discipline by making myself suffer, but this is not
      true! People often mistake self-discipline for suffering, but that is not the case at all. The key thing is to be able to
      feel good in situations that don't usually feel good to you. This way you can face challenges more easily and readily.
      In addition to this, as a high achieving STEM student, there's always that little bit of pride that comes with you. You
      might be used to do everything completely alone or being ahead of everyone in your class. This is completely normal, but 
      it can also build some pent up emotions on the side that only hold you back. Part of becoming comfortable with the 
      uncomfortable is letting go of that pride you hold and being able to accept failure and rejection. For example, say you're
      struggling with a math problem for hours but you hold too much pride to be able to ask for help with it because you've
      always been solving everything on your own and people expect you to know a lot. You'll feel like a complete imposter if
      people find out that you're not able to solve something. By doing that, the only person you're hurting is yourself. The
      true thing is that even though some people may make a comment, in the end they don't care as much as you think they do.
      If you can expose yourself to mistakes, failure, rejection etc, you can only improve. You can learn from all of this and
      if you're purposely avoiding every way to potentially embarrass yourself or look worse than another then you're only 
      setting yourself back. It's completely ok to be imperfect.
