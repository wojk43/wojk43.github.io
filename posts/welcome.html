      <h2>Welcome to the website!</h2>
      <h5>25 Nov 2022</h5>
      <p>This page was created to talk about the purpose of the website, what motivates it, what's on it etc.</p>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of the website consists of four main things. 
      <ul>
        <li>To share insights to interesting things that I found</li>
        <li>To be able to express myself freely and talk about things I enjoy</li>
        <li>Provide resources and advice to high-achieving upcoming undergraduates</li>
        <li>Provide resources to current undergraduadtes</li>
      </ul>
      In summary, help people and express myself freely.
      <h3>Motivation</h3>
      I would describe myself as quite a studious person. The fact that I enjoy math by itself could be quite the tell.
      As a consequence of this, I have a lot of practice, sit a lot of papers, learn a lot of things etc. that otherwise would
      take a very long time to do. With that in mind, it does not take a lot of effort to transfer some of that to other people 
      and help out. After all, we should help each other out when we can :)
      <h3>Contents</h3>
      <p> As of right now, the content of the website is quite limited, but here is what is available as of right now: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>My personal blog</li>
        <li>An interview page to aid highschoolers with their Oxbridge interviews</li>
        <li>A STEP page to aid highschoolers in STEP preparation</li>
        <li>An about me page to get to know me</li>
        <li>A support me page so you can find out ways to support this website :)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Future plans for the website</h3>
      <p>Of course, you may have noticed that there are a lot of unavailable parts of the websites... Some of these may provide
      hints of whats to come already, however here is a complete list of what I have planned for now:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Writing an MAT section</li>
        <li>Adding additional STEP resources and sorting them by category</li>
        <li>Making a contact me section on the right-hand side</li>
        <li>Filling the competition page, slowly but surely, or maybe revamping it</li>
        <li>Creating a solution repository for past papers and also problems sheets I personally created</li>
        <li>Uploading resources here. Handouts, problem sheets and video explanations.</li>
      </ul>
