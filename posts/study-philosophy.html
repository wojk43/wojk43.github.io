      <h2>My study philosophy and how I learn</h2>
      <h5>Soon</h5>
      <p>This page was created to talk about my attitude to studying, how I approach it and how I'm able to fit it into the bigger picture of life.</p>
        
      <p> As humans, we all strive to make our lives easier if possible. While it is true that taking shortcuts isn't always good, that does not mean that
        every shortcut is bad. You can make life easier for yourself or more efficient by working smarter and not harder. You can put less hours in and get
        out more if you know what you're doing. If you know what you want to do. This is exactly what I'm going to talk about here. I'm going to talk about
        what I do to study, why I do it, how you can adapt this and apply it to yourself and then talk about how it fits into the bigger picture of life. </p>
        
        <h3> Study sessions </h3>
        <p> A lot of information is going to be unloaded on this page, so firstly I'd like to get some things out of the way that are going to be referred to. 
        There are 5 main study "reps" that I'm going to be referring to, which I shall break down further later on. These are: </p>
        <ul>
          <li> Question Based (Q-B) </li>
          <li> Content Learning Based (CL-B) </li>
          <li> Content Learning and Question Hybrid (CLQ-Hybrid) </li>
          <li> Exam questions / papers (EQ) </li>
          <li> Content Review </li>
        </ul>
        <p> I will not refer to these as their shorthand, namely Q-B, CL-B, CLQ-Hybrid, EQ and obviously content review which has no shorthand. 
          These are the 5 main study reps and I'm going to talk about when and how to implement each, including how long and how you can easily adapt
          these to your own schedules. Obvioously, I'm a math student so this blog post is very math-centric. If you're a struggling English student for example,
          this blog post may still help you, but not as much as it could help a STEM student. Additionally, it could be a bit harder to adapt but I believe that
          with enough creativity, it can be adapted to anyones needs. </p>
      
        <h4> Organizing sessions </h4>
      
        <p> Here I'm going to talk about how to organize sessions effectively before going into the nuances of each session. When I say study session, it can mean
          two things. One thing it could mean it a singular study rep. A term I coined from working out where a rep stands for repetition, and its the amount of study
          you do with no breaks. Another thing it could mean is a study set. This is the amount of study you do with breaks in between. Just like with working out,
          too much of either leads to suboptimal results. Of course, doing an 18 hour study rep is better than doing nothing. But thinking about it long term, it's
          not very sustainable. You'll get a lot of work done, but by the time you're a few hours in, your mind is going to be wandering and before you know it,
          most of it hasn't even been studying in the first place. You were super distracted and you couldn't help it. Alright, how about an 18 hour study set?
          While you may stay focused for the entirety of the 18 hours, this is still suboptimal. You'll have very little free time and it'll easily lead to burning
          out. It may not affect you for a few days, maybe even a week or maybe even a few months. But eventually, you'll burnout after working so much and you 
          won't be able to muster up the strength to do any work. This burnout could last as long as it wants and it's hard to do much about it. </p>
      
        <p> How much you actually study, is up to you. I for one, want to study 8-12 hours per day. This may seem like a lot to the average person, but to me its
          a good number. It allows me to get a lot of work done, and with good sleeping habits, I still have half of the day free to do whatever else I want. 
          If you think about it by numbers, 8 hours of sleep, 8 hours of work, 8 hours of free time. Now, this could be problematic for some as some readers may
          be highschool students of some sort, where they have mandatory school and they cant afford to do this much study in their own time. Of course, every 
          person should study however much they feel is needed and works with their own timetable. I, for one, do not go to lectures because I don't find them
          very useful and can learn content anywhere else. Another person, might struggle with reading formal texts and prefers to go to lectures to get content
          explained to them. That is all completely fine. One must find how much time works for them. </p>
      
        <p> Now that we got the amount of study out of the way, lets talk about how you should split up your sessions. Me personally, I like getting all of my 
          study done at once in one set. I still take breaks in between, but in my opinion having to do all your work in one go rather than splitting it into
          many sets takes your mind off everything at the end of the day. This way, instead of doing things out of fear or worry that you haven't done enough
          work, you are able to do everything because you want to, have a great start to the day and feel productive later in the day without doing anything.
          Now in the holidays, I'm taking a break from everything to keep my mental health in check. Since discipline isn't about making you suffer, extended
          breaks are important as mentioned in the self-discipline blog post. However, on a usual day I sleep at 10pm and wake up at 6am. I get out of bed,
          make my bed, get dressed and start working as soon as im ready. This could be 6:15am, this could be 6:30am. It doesn't really matter. What I'm trying
          to get at isn't that you should also wake up at 6am every day to study. What I'm trying to say is that studying in the morning allows you to get it 
          out of the way and have more free time later. Lets say I do indeed start studying at 6:30am, I'll finish an 8 hour study set by the time its 2:30pm.
          Now I'll have the rest of the day free. It's really as simple as that, and in the morning I'm least distracted so it's easiest to do work. Now, not
          everyone can have the opportunity to do this. While I think it's better to do everything in one set, for some people it is not possible to do so. In
          this case, you should split it into multiple sets, but my advice is that longer sets (within reason) genuinely work better, especially in the case of
          failure of following through later on. For example, say you have a lecture or work at 10am and you woke up at 6am. You cannot do an 8 hour study set 
          here. Additionally, work can be very tiring, or the lecture can also be tiring. Regardless of how long these take you, you might not be motivated to
          study at all when you get home. Of course, if your work is too long, then you shouldn't study too much in the first place as using free time is very
          important too. But the point is that you already did a 3 hour study set before, so even if you're super unmotivated or can't do anything when you're
          back, you already put in a heap of work today. </p>
      
        <p> The next topic I'll touch upon regarding study sessions is how long your reps should be. I make my reps 50 minutes long with 10 minute breaks in 
          between. Frankly, if your reps are shorter or longer, it doesn't matter too much. The most important part is to take breaks proportionate to how 
          long you decide to work. The reason why I make my reps 50 minutes long is because I feel like it's hard to get enough meaningful work done in a shorter
          amount of time. You may be wondering, well what about EQ (Exam questions / papers) then? How will you get those done in 50 minutes? The thing is that 
          even though I generally have 50 minute reps, this still variable rather than fixed. If decide to do a 3 hour exam, I'll do a 3 hour exam and then I'll
          take a 30-40 minute break in between, proportionate to the amount of work I had to do. Why do I use this ratio of breaks? Well firstly, it rounds nicely
          to the hour. That's not too important but it makes time management much easier for myself personally. The more important reason is that I feel like 10
          minutes per 50 minutes of work is enough time to unwind, maybe go for a short walk, clear your head, destress etc before going into work, allowing you 
          to keep your head in the game for the rest of the set. </p>
      
        <p> I believe that this concludes the topic of organizing the sessions themselves, and now I'll go onto the specifics of the study reps themselves. </p>
      
        <h4> The Question-Based rep (Q-B) </h4>
        
        <p> A Q-B rep consists of... just doing questions! Even though the main focus is doing questions, a little more goes into it too. Some people look at 
          questions, attempt them for a few seconds, don't see how to do them instantly and try to refer to a solution or give up. Instead, I believe that when
          doing questions, one should instead struggle for around 20 minutes first. This is because the solution may not always be obvious at first but may come
          later with a little bit of thinking. There are many approaches to many questions, so you may think of trying different ways to solve the problems or 
          look at different properties to see if they help you. For example, if you see an integral you don't know how to evaluate but you see some term that 
          looks similar to a trigonometric identity, you may as well try to see if you can perform said trigonometric substitution. It may help, it may not help,
          but one way to find out is to try it. When you get better, you'll get more familiar with what can work and what won't work. </p>
  
        <p> What if you still can't think of something in those 20 minutes of trying? That's when you get a <b>hint</b>. You still don't look at the solution.
          Now, with this hint you proceed as you did before and repeat. Sometimes this may seem super tedious, and it is. If you think you've realistically 
          spend long enough on the question and you just can't get anywhere, you look at the solution only then. And that is how you do a question properly.
          Sometimes questions will take up to 5 minutes, sometimes they can take up to a couple of hours. Questions can be very difficult but also very rewarding.
          And when I say rewarding, I mean a few things, mainly satisfaction and being able to take something away from solving these questions. </p>
      
        <p> Now I'll quickly talk about how to use Q-B to it's full effect. Borrowed from Neel Nanda, questions are 80% trivial algebra or tedious working anyone 
          can do, 10% key skills and 10% "magic" tricks. What I mean by magic trick is that something pops up that is only relevant to the current question. You'll
          probably never use this trick again and it's hard to spot in itself. A key skill is something recurring that can be applied in multiple different problems
          rather than just this particular one. I'll talk a little bit more about this in the content review section, but for now I'll say that what you should be
          doing is trying to remember these key skills. When you do a question successfully, write down what you're able to take away from it, what went wrong etc.
          This way you're able to reflect on the question and then next time you do a question you'll spot a similar approach. This is how we improve based on our
          mistakes. A good skill to learn in particular is being able to differentiate these key skills from the magic tricks, knowing whats useful and what's not.
          This may take some time to perfect, but with time it'll become easier separate. </p>
          
        <p> So when should you perform these reps? You should perform these reps if: </p>
          <ul>
            <li> You're trying to embed content in your mind </li>
            <li> You're trying to get better at answering certain types of questions </li>
            <li> You haven't look at a topic in a while and need to start relearning it </li>
          </ul>
         <p> These sessions should be performed regularly, even on a day to day basis and are by far the most important rep of all listed. </p>
      
      
        <h4> The Content Learning Based rep (CL-B) </h4>
      
        <p> This rep consists <b>solely</b> of learning content. No questions are involved. Only remembering content, writing notes, watching material etc. This can
          be done in various methods. I'm personally very fond of mathematical texts. Whether it be other peoples notes or textbooks in general. For some people, this
          may not be ideal for some people as reading advanced texts is also a skill to develop, but in my opinion it is the most efficient way of learning. Not only
          is it the most efficient way of learning, its also the most accessible way of learning. There are millions of free resources published online for people on
          everything, however if one was to watch a video to understand a topic, there's quite a low probability a video covered some very niche area of what you're
          trying to learn. For example, there are thousands of videos on say, factorizing a quadratic. However, if you wanted to learn more about BPST instantons for 
          example, while you could still probably find a video on these, theres probably like 2 videos on this published on the internet. Worse yet, if it was explained
          unclearly then you'd have no where else to go. That being said, videos aren't necessarily bad. There are plenty of videos online even in advanced mathematics
          and they can be very useful. </p>
          
        <p> These reps aren't always necessary, as one could just dive into a CLQ-Hybrid session, however the purpose of this is to try to fit in as much content as
          possible in a short amount of time. Essentially, this is almost like having a long CLQ-Hybrid session that's split up. The idea of these is almost like
          simulating a lecture or a lesson in your own time and then doing questions another time or after some break. However, if this rep is not performed then a 
          CLQ-Hybrid rep should be performed as content still needs to be learned in one way or another. The best way of reinforcing content is with questions, so in
          one way or another when you learn content, make sure to not leave it at that. Reading or watching videos is not enough.  </p>
      
        <h4> The Content Learning and Question Hybrid rep (CLQ-Hybrid) </h4>
        
        <p> This rep is a mix between Q-B and CL-B. The principle to answering questions is the same as in Q-B and the principle to learning content is the same as
          CL-B. However, the only difference is that after each piece of content you learn, you attempt to answer some questions on it. Whether it be after finishing
          a quick subtopic or more, this is the bridge between doing both at once. The downsides to this is that you may not get a lot of work done at once and also
          that once you learn content once, you may think you won't need to come back to it because you were able to do questions at that time. Of course, if you're 
          able to answer questions on a given topic, you understood it properly. However, just because you were able to answer everything properly while everything
          was very fresh in your mind, doesn't mean you learned the content properly. That is why Q-B reps are so important. Whether a CLQ-Hybrid rep is performed
          or a CL-B rep is performed, it is always important to put in Q-B reps at different times of the day. </p>
