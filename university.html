  <p> This page will be split into three sections. </p>
  <ul>
    <li> Personal blog, interesting things I found along the way etc. </li>
  </ul>
  <p> Here I'm going to talk about everything related to me. My personal experiences and interesting math problems I find. These could be any level or from anywhere, 
    it'll just be a collection of things that I find would be nice if shared. </p>
  <ul> 
    <li> Notes </li>
  </ul>
  <p> These will not necessarily be lecture notes. They will not be Durham notes, nor any other university, rather a comprehensive guide on topics.
    This is because each university has different things to offer or offers it in another course and I think that it is best to compile it all into one. </p>
  <ul> 
    <li> Competitions and news </li>
  </ul>
  <p> This will include any undergraduate competitions with problems and solutions and also information about them. </p>
