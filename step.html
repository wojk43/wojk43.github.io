      <h2>STEP (Sixth Term Examination Paper)</h2>
      <h3> What is STEP? </h3>
      <p> STEP is a mathematics admissions test sat by A-level students (or equivalent). 
        It is designed to assess mathematical problem-solving ability and is required by certain universities, including: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Cambridge (Mathematics, sometimes engineering. typical offer being 1,1) </li>
        <li> Imperial College London (Computer science, typical offer being 2 in any paper) </li>
      </ul>
      <h3> Papers </h3>
      <p> There are <b>two</b> STEP papers currently in use; STEP II and STEP III. Each paper has 12 questions. </p>
      <ul>
      <li> There are 8 pure questions.</li>
      <li> There are 2 mechanics questions.</li>
      <li> There are 2 stats questions.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3> Difficulty</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The papers are supposed to be equal in difficulty.</li>
        <li>STEP II draws on A-Level mathematics content and AS further maths content.</li>
        <li>STEP III draws on both A-Level mathematics content and A-Level further maths content.</li>
        <li>Anything examinable in STEP II may also appear in STEP III.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Question choice</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>You do not need to solve all 12 questions.</li>
        <li>The paper is out of 120 marks, all carrying equal weight.</li>
        <li>Only your 6 best attempts are marked and counted.</li>
        <li>To achieve a grade 1, you typically only need 4 strong solutions.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Restrictions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>A calculator is not permitted.</li>
        <li>Scrap paper nor formulae booklets are not permitted.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Key points to remember</h3>
      <ul>
      <li> STEP is not about speed - it is better to answer a few questions very well than many scruffily.</li>
      <li> Even partial working can give you marks. If you have not attempted 6 problems, try to do so, every mark counts!</li>
      <li> Practicing writing full solutions under timed conditions is a really good way to prepare.</li>
      </ul>
