      <h3>Further explanation</h3>
      <p> I love math, whether it be learning new concepts or strengthening old ones. 
        What better way of practicing those concepts than doing many questions on them. I started doing papers, 
        whether it be past Durham papers or Tripos papers. 
        But, if I’m doing them, knowing that there are no official solutions for them anywhere, 
        why not take the few extra minutes uploading my solutions online? 
        It is not a big hassle for me to do so and could help out other people tremendously :)
        and that is precisely the reason behind making this page. </p>
      <h3> Navigation and contents</h3>
      <p> This main page is split into two sections, Cambridge and Durham. 
        These then split further into year groups / part of your degree so for example Cambridge is split up into IA, IB, II, III
        and Durham is split between years. 
        Now, past this, each of these pages are split between courses. 
        So for example, there is a section for each IA course at Cambridge and each first year course at Durham. 
        Past this, the solutions are just split between years, e.g Analysis I 2014 solutions etc.
        Alright, that’s for the navigation of this folder. 
        As for contents, I’m still a Durham undergraduate student so my main priorities are papers that can help me with my degree
        and also papers from courses that I enjoy. 
        Now, this doesn’t mean that Tripos papers are going to be done any less, 
        rather it means that I may focus on specific papers more than others. 
        As of right now, my favourite area of math is Algebra in a broad sense. 
        So with that, I will do Algebra II, Galois Theory III etc. papers from Durham as well as Groups, GRM etc. papers from Cambridge. 
        On the other hand, there are courses which I haven’t even looked at such as the Automata and Formal Languages course. 
        Of course, these may never even get done as there are over 100 courses all together from both of the universities combined, and even more papers. <p>
      <p> On that quick note, there is a page which describes all the current contents of the folder so you don’t have to look through the folders to reach a disappointing, empty folder.
