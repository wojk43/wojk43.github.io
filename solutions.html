      <h4>Further explanation</h4>
      <p> I love math, whether it be learning new concepts or strengthening old ones. 
        What better way of practicing those concepts than doing many questions on them. I started doing papers, 
        whether it be past Durham papers or Tripos papers. 
        But, if I’m doing them, knowing that there are no official solutions for them anywhere, 
        why not take the few extra minutes uploading my solutions online? 
        It is not a big hassle for me to do so and could help out other people tremendously :)
        and that is precisely the reason behind making this page. </p>
      <h4> Navigation and contents</h4>
      <p> This main page is split into two sections, Cambridge and Durham. 
        These then split further into year groups / part of your degree so for example Cambridge is split up into IA, IB, II, III
        and Durham is split between years. 
        Now, past this, each of these pages are split between courses. 
        So for example, there is a section for each IA course at Cambridge and each first year course at Durham. 
        Past this, the solutions are just split between years, e.g Analysis I 2014 solutions etc.
        Alright, that’s for the navigation of this folder. 
        As for contents, I’m still a Durham undergraduate student so my main priorities are papers that can help me with my degree
        and also papers from courses that I enjoy. 
        Now, this doesn’t mean that Tripos papers are going to be done any less, 
        rather it means that I may focus on specific papers more than others. 
        As of right now, my favourite area of math is Algebra in a broad sense. 
        So with that, I will do Algebra II, Galois Theory III etc. papers from Durham as well as Groups, GRM etc. papers from Cambridge. 
        On the other hand, there are courses which I haven’t even looked at such as the Automata and Formal Languages course. 
        Of course, these may never even get done as there are over 100 courses all together from both of the universities combined, and even more papers. <p>
      <p> On that quick note, there is a page which describes all the current contents of the folder so you don’t have to look through the folders to reach a disappointing, empty folder.
      </p>
      <h4>Future plans</h4>
      <p> As mentioned before, the main purpose of this folder is to practice myself while being able to help others with their practice along the way. 
      With that being said, the aim is to fill as much of this folder as possible with as many solved papers as I can. 
      Something that is not a priority as of right now but is planned for the future is also writing up my solutions in Latex. 
      This is extremely time-consuming but also helpful for the majority of people visiting. 
      However, do not wait for this because who knows when it’ll come or if it’ll even come at all. </p>
      <h4>How you can help</h4>
      <p> There are three main ways you, as a visitor, can help support this folder. 
        It is kept permanently free and it does not cost any money to run, so the help required isn’t anything materialistic. </p>
      <p>Firstly, you can point out any errors I make in my solutions. I do make mistakes with my work.</p>
      <p>Secondly, notice that there are many sub-sections that are empty. 
        This can probably be inferred from what I’ve written previously, but visitors are welcome to submit their own solutions too. 
        These just need to be sent to me directly and I’ll put them on. 
        Whether it be an already solved paper or a paper that isn’t there yet. 
        It may seem redundant to have multiple papers with solutions for a particular year,
        however the reason why this is good is because many problems can be solved using alternative methods. 
        Now, when I’m solving papers, I will probably utilize the one that first comes to mind when I’m solving the paper. 
        You may not have the same approach… however! Someone else that has solved the paper might’ve.</p>
      <p> Lastly, if any of my past solutions are able to be typed out by someone using latex while I haven’t gotten around to it yet,
        then that would also be of significant help. </p>
      <p>Of course… none of these methods of helping are necessary and the user may feel free to just use the folder without hesitation</p>
      <p>If you do not know me, then contacting me may be pretty hard and I haven’t put any contact details down yet… however I will in due time so apologies in advance.</p>
