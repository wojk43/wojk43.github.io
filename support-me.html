      <p>Hi! Here's how you're currently able to support me:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Report any mistakes on the website </li>
        <p> Sometimes, there are typos or links take you to the wrong place. Maybe a link doesn't exist at all in fact. Please report this
          if you find anything :) </p>
        <li> Report any errors made in the <a href=handouts>handouts</a> </li>
        <p> I create the examples from scratch and see what would work and sometimes when working forward again I make some mistakes... </p>
        <li> Report any mistakes made in the past paper solution repository </li>
        <p> I'm slowly starting to work on this... but once again, I make a lot of mistakes, especially arithmetic mistakes. Sometimes, there
          may even be a logical flaw. If you believe that I did something wrong, please contact me! </p>
        <li> Submit latex versions of my past paper solutions </li>
        <p> As I'm working on the repository, I don't have enough time to latex my solutions. Alas, that's not the reason I decided to work on
          this in the first place but it doesn't hurt to post these solutions online </p>
        <li> Submit your own past paper solutions! </li>
        <p> I can't get to all past papers, and some modules I don't even do. For example, it would be a reach for me to try to complete a 
          Mathematical Biology paper whereas other people may have already one the papers </p>
        <li> Contact me with any suggestions you have pertaining the website! </li>
        <p> I want to make this website as user-friendly and inviting as possible. The aim is to help people and be able to express myself. If
          you know a method with which I could provide better help then please let me know! </p>
      </ul>
