      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>Hello! I'm Wojciech, a first year math student at Durham University :) Hopefully is just the beginning of my long math career.
        As for me, I like studying math, enjoy learning languages, playing some games and currently <i>trying</i> to get into kendo. 
        Unfortunately, I was never a music person. Of course, I listen to it a lot but I don't play any instruments, call me boring. </p>
      
      <h3>What I'm currently working on</h3>
      <p>Right now, my topic of interest quite broadly is <i>Algebra</i> in quite a broad sense. More specifically, right now I'm working
      on concepts in ring theory so that I can eventually build up to Galois theory. Other than than, there is quite a large personal
      project that I'm working on... however I cannot share that just yet :)</p>
      
      <h3>My future plans</h3>
      <p> Other than trying to expand this website as much as possible, I want to be able to live my life to the fullest and be able to say
      I did not regret a single moment of my undergraduate degree. With this, as well as pursuing my own interests and developing my abilities
      in mathematics and other hobbies, I want to share what I've learned over this time to help and guide others. My love of mathematics is
      making me chase more and more topics. Even though these comes with many adversities, eventually just like everything else they become 
      easier... and through that I'm also able to help other people overcome these adversities! Hopefully in the future I'm able to gather 
      together everything I've done and condense it onto this website, as a large resource where I can not only express myself but help others
      excel as well.</p>
