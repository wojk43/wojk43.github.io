  <h2> What is BMO </h2>
  <p> BMO, standing for British Mathematical Olympiad, is a math competition sat by British or other eligible students that are not yet at university. 
    This means that students that are 14 years old can sit it just as well as students that are 18 years old. 
    You can qualify for BMO1 with good SMC (senior math competition) score or by paying. If qualified properly, there is no payment involved.
    You can qualify for BMO2 with a good BMO1 score or once more by paying. If qualified properly, there is no payment involved.
    In general, more information about all of this can be found <a href="https://bmos.ukmt.org.uk/">here</a>
